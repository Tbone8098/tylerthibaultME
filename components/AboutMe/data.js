        <p>
            I am a full stack developer and a tech educator. I have worked a lot in Python with the flask framework as well as the Django framework. I have also spend many hours within the MERN stack and C# with ASP.NET. When it comes to picking a favorite technology suite I think I would have to pick something that works with React at the moment. Nextjs with Prisma as a database and tailwind as a CSS framework is currently my go to. However, I am a life long learner so this is bound to change at some point in the future. I think I have quite an interesting history and if you would like to know more about me and my life you can click the link below.

            I was born in Washington state and raised in both WA and Indonesia. My parents moved my two brothers and I to Indonesia when we were kids (1996) to teach there and give us a good dose of international experience before heading back to the US. While there I met my future wife, Kendal, although we wouldn't know it until I was in the Navy and she was in college over ten years later.

            Six months after graduating high school I enlisted in the Navy (2008), which gave me a solid dose of living and working on an aircraft carrier for 8 months at a time and getting to sail around the world. Towards the end of my 5 years in the Navy, I finally won Kendal over and we started dating and got engaged not too long after (2013). I wasn't overly satisfied with Navy life so when Kendal made me choose between her or the Navy the decision was easy.

            I moved back to Indonesia in January of 2014, married my beautiful wife in June, and started an education degree in July at UPH ("University of light and hope" in Indonesian). The International Teachers College at UPH was connected to an American university called Corban University so I was able to get both an Indonesian and American bachelor's degree in elementary education.

            After completing my degree I began teaching 4th grade at the school Kendal and I went to as kids, where mine and her parents taught, and where she was already teaching (2017). During these years of going to school and starting my teaching career, our two sons were born, Theophilus and Zebadiah.

            In March of 2020, the pandemic shut down Indonesia as it did much of the world. We decided to pack up our life in Indonesia a few months earlier than planned and head to the States to start the next chapter of life. It was stressful leaving the country and moving half way around the world mid pandemic. Nobody knew at that point how things were going to go, so we left when we could so that we would be ready to shart the next chapter.

            As a classroom teacher, quickly realized that, besides hanging out with the kids, my favorite part about teaching was building programs that made my job easier and the content easier to teach. I was diving into computer coding every chance I got and teaching myself via YouTube.

            Getting more structured training in the realm of computer languages was the first step in my career change and Coding Dojo was where it happened. I completed the program with a triple black belt, and began Teacher Assisting at the Dojo while enrolled in my second boot camp at University of Washington. This second boot camp gave me the chance to hone in on one language, JavaScript within the framework of React.

            After completing these two boot camps, I got hired by Coding Dojo as an Associate Instructor, graduating to a full instructor within my first year. At the same time, my family made another significant transition from living at my parents' to buying a 5th wheel RV and beginning our travels. We have had amazing opportunities so far traveling across the country fulltime. As long as we have internet, I can do my job online!
